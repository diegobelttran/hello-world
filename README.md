My name is Diego Beltr√°n, I'm an evolutionary biologist interested in macroevolution, biodiversity and phenotypic evolution. I like birds as a study organism, because they're easy to find and interesting, but mostly because I like them. I've focused so far in hummingbirds and their coloration, studying how color influences the speciation process and its involvement in sexual and natural selection.

I use R as platform for all of my code, which is related to Phylogenetic Comparative Methods mostly, although some is also focused on Bayesian Mixed-Effect Models, but I'm new at this so I expect to learn much more in the near future.
